--Issues
This was my first foray into PHP and it came with a decent number of hiccups. First I had to install about 100 things, including MAMP, PHP, Composer, Laravel, and more. This was issue enough, as they aren't all necessarily compatible with one another depending on what version you install, and especially as it pertains to Heroku, which is somewhat specific about which version of composer/php you're using.
